Django Web Development: Creating a blog (using CRUD functionality)

Topic: COVID-19 News/posting

I am planning to create a website for a blog application where the blog content can be created and updated through an administration panel. It will list out my post as first, second, and third, etc. Blog contents are displayed on the page and can be deleted if needed. 

The overall application provides the create, read, update, delete (CRUD) functionality.  I create a login page to make a post. I will create this as similar to "cats" and "movies" apps. These are the example of how I am planning to create a blog surface.

Also, I will make a log in page to log-in and see the blog to edit or delete.
